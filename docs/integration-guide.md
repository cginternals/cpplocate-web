## Integration of a new Documentation

The following manual steps are necessary for each added documentation:

1. Create a subfolder with the name of the release identifier (e.g., master, v2.0)
2. Copy contents of Doxygen html folder into directory
3. Add documentation meta data to ```docs/docs.pug```
4. Adjust the sort order of the documentations array in the config file; the order is used for display
